## Java Check Style 
This is a duplicate of Google Check style's document, with a few changes to the original. 
- Line-length is 120 characters.
- Indentation-length is 4 spaces. 
- All import checks are deleted; imports can be used in random order and can include wildcards.  
- Catch exception naming convention changed from ^[a-z][a-z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*$ to ^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$; name convention allows for names like 'e'.
